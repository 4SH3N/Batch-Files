the counter deletes the files and sets the date back

on the "hub" there are 2 pre-defined paths - write scripts > notepad and draw > paint the rest you have to manually assign

the virus protector aborts shutting down pc, backs important files up to a pendrive and shuts down the pc (everything

except aborting shutdown is on demand, the program asks if it should do all this)

the Packet Route Tracer uses tracert to trace packets to the desired hostname/ip address

Trace IP shows the location of the IP

and Find and Trace combines Trace IP and Packet Route Tracer, it shows a hostname's IP and tracks it down

The mp4 downloader downloads a youtube video (not tested on other sites) and saves it in .mp4

no_anime.bat keeps you away from bad influence of anime.

no_anime_ui.bat does the same thing, however ui version has an awesome user-friendly user interface
